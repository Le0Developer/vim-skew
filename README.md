# skew-lang support for vim

Just basic syntax highlighting for [skew-lang](https://evanw.github.io/skew-lang.org/).

This is based on the [TextMate Grammar file](https://github.com/evanw/skew-vscode/blob/master/syntaxes/Skew.tmLanguage), converted using Copilot and then tweaked a bit.

This is not perfect, but good enough for me.
